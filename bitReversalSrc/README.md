Bit Reversal Exercise 
=====================

__Copyright (c) 2019 Rob Hemesley__

Compile and run unit tests by running 'make' from a command line. 
Tested with gcc version 5.4.0
Unity unit-test harness is included. 

The default makefile is written to compile bitrev2.c and can be 
reworked to compile bitrev1.c or any alternative source file by editing 
the line that begins with "SRC_FILES1=$(UNITY_ROOT)/src/unity.c src/bitrev2.c "

After compilation, the unit tests will run and the output will be 
displayed.
